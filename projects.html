                <b>Embedded System for Access Control Based on Facial Biometry and RFID (2018 - 2018)</b>
                <br/>
                <b>Description: </b>With the constant technological evolution, every day human beings look for automated ways to guarantee the safety of certain places. Inevitably, the use of face recognition becomes an important mechanism for access control, since each person has practically unique facial features. However, it is also necessary to develop tools together for validation of these faces, to ensure that the present user is authentic, not just an image or video being transmitted. Besides, we note the high cost of such products in the market. Therefore, this work proposes to develop an embedded system for access control with low cost, and that meets all the requirements for correct identification and validation of faces.

                <b>Security Aspects in Multi-Domain Resource Slicing of Future Cloud Networking (2018 - 2018)</b>
                <br/>
                <b>Description: </b>Cloud slicing allows the existence of multiple virtual infrastructures, called virtual slices, on top of the physical infrastructure of federated data centers, each one specially adapted to the needs of the tenants. Although cloud-slicing makes services and networks more agile and responsive to users' business requirements, it adds new security concerns because of how physical resources are shared between slices and how isolation is held. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to propose a methodology to increase security levels in federated cloud platforms defined by resource slices, which exploits virtualization technologies to enable secure resource sharing and isolation, management of heterogeneous security policies, and the provision of risk mitigation actions using the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) technologies.

                <b>License Plate Automatic Recognition System (2016 - 2017)</b>
                <br/>
                <b>Description: </b>This project proposes an embedded system capable of extracting the text of a license plate through Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using low-cost hardware. The developed system is also able to query a Brazilian national database to identify the status of the vehicle and driver.
